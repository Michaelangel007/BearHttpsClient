```


If  you are on Linux, you can download the lib with:

```

## Compile on Linux

To compile the lib in **Linux** you can use the following command:
```bash
gcc main.c -o your_output.out
```

## Compile on Windows

To compile the lib in **Windows** you can use the following commands

With Microsoft Visual C:
```cmd
cl.exe examples\example_simple.c /Fe:bin\example_simple.exe
```

With mingw64:
```bash
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc examples\example_simple.c -o bin\example_simple.exe -lws2_32
```

### Full Folder
If you want to use the lib in full folder mode,you can just include the **src/one.c** file in your project:
```c
#include "src/one.c"
```

### Calling the Build Script
if you want to regenerate the amalgamations and silverchain organization you can call these:
```bash
sh compile_darwin.sh
#call the tools to reorganize the project and generate the amalgamation
sh darwin_build.sh
```

### If you want to reinstall dependneices
```bash
sh installldependencies.sh 
```

### Mocking dependencies or dependencies implementations 

The following defines toggle dependencies or just the definitions.
It is useful for  working with dynamic compilation or mocking dependencies.
```c
// unallow universal socket definition
#define BEARSSL_HTTPS_MOCK_UNIVERSAL_SOCKET_DEFINE

// unallow universal socket implementation
#define BEARSSL_HTTPS_MOCK_BEARSSL_DEFINE

// unallow cjson at all
// NOTE: Hiding CJSON will force the lib to use **get_addrinfo** which
// can leak memory in some cases.
#define BEARSSL_HTTPS_MOCK_CJSON

// unallow cjson definition
#define BEARSSL_HTTPS_MOCK_CJSON_DEFINE

//import the lib only after the flags
#include "BearHttpsClientOne.c"
```
