#### Configure Dns Provider
you can configure the dns provider that will be used to retriver the url ip
```c
BearHttpsClientDnsProvider providers[] = {
    {.hostname= "dns.quad9.net",.route="/dns-query",.ip = "9.9.9.9",.port=5053},
    {.hostname= "dns.google.com",.route="/resolve",.ip = "8.8.8.8",.port=443},
    {.hostname= "dns.nextdns.io",.route="/dns-query",.ip = "217.146.9.93",.port=443},
};
int total_providers = sizeof(providers)/sizeof(BearHttpsClientDnsProvider);
bear.request.set_dns_providers(request,providers,total_providers);

```

#### Using **getaddrinfo**
by default , the lib  dont use **getaddrinfo** to resolve the url ip , but you can enable it by allowing it with the flag:

```c
#define BEARSSL_USSE_GET_ADDRINFO
#include "BearHttpsClientOne.c"
```

but note that , these functions, can generate leak memorys on some platforms, so use it with caution

#### Configure Trusted anchors
by default, the lib uses the trusted anchors of [Mozila Trusted Anchors](https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem), generated by the 
**BearSSL/build/brssl** with the command **./BearSSL/build/brssl ta cacert.pem **  on file **dependenciesBearSSLTrustAnchors.h**
,check [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/) for more information.You can configure your own trusted anchors with the function:
```c
bear.request.set_trusted_anchors(request,trusted_anchors,trusted_anchros_size);

```
